### Mounting

As we are using Velmex motorized stages for all three axes of motion, the current base plate for mounting is quite large. The mounting plate size can be modified if you keep the hole distances in the bottom the same. The two mounting brackets are made from aluminum mainly so that they can be securely mounted to the base with threaded holes.

Material used: MIC6 cast aluminum, ½” thickness
